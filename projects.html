                <p>A series of letterpress prints made with wood & metal type and hand-carved mountboard prints. Made on occasion of a months-long residency at the Caseroom @ SWG3, these designs use the unique wood type collection available at the workshop, notably this unusual, playful, very Glaswegian condensed sans. 
                Precisely planned out on the paper in picas, these posters illustrate chosen lines from Scottish poet Edwin Morgan. </p>

                <p><i>“We live here. We lie in the Present's unopened <br/>Sorrow; its limits are what we are.  <br/>The prisoner ought never to pardon his cell.  <br/> Can future ages ever escape so far,  <br/>Yet feel derived from everything that happened,  <br/> Even from us, that even this was well?" </i></p>
                <p>This typographic installation  is based on an excerpt from W.H. Auden's long poem on the history of humanity and its relationship to war and violence, <i>In Time of War</i>. This particular verse deals with the human condition's shackling to the present time. The combination of 2D and 3D letters creates a physical space which encourages the viewer to visualise and conceptualise the present moment and its fleeting nature. This installation marries the communicative power of typography with the visual and ___ impact of the sculptural form, taking inspiration from the public art movement and letterpress designers such as Anthony Burrill.</p> <p>The typeface was custom-designed as a cross between iconic advertising font Franklin Gothic and an undigitised, incomplete wood type from GSA’s extensive Caseroom collection, marrying Auden’s American penchants with his Britishness and adding subtle quirks to known and efficient base. </p>
                <p>This piece was displayed centrally at the 2024 Glasgow School of Art Degree Show and was very successful among faculty, board members, and attendants alike. Images of the installation are currently used in the internal and external communications of the school. <i>Photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/glasgowschoolart/albums/72177720319051110/page2"> © Alan McAteer.</a></i></p>

                <p>Everyone Is Keeping Score is a publication which marries modernist design aesthetics and principles with literary and philosophical approaches to the game of baseball, taken from the works of writers and scholars such as A. Bartlett Giamatti, Paul Goldberger, and Alva Noë. It seeks to highlight the surprising idiosyncracies of the game by communicating them through a sophisticated visual language, using the contrast to strip expectations and preconceptions from the viewer. The volume is hand-sewn and bound, with a Swiss case, a dye-cut cover, double endpapers, and a foldover spread.                     </p>

                <p>It spent the fall of 2024 on display at the Glasgow School of Art Library, before taking a journey up to the GSA Highlands and Islands campus in Forres for exhibition in the winter. </p>

Provided with an exceptional collection of photographs and information gleaned from letters, accounting books, and personal memories, I designed a template that would allow to let the different media flow appropriately, while being easy to hold and read by elderly readers.</p> <p>Special thought was put into the type choice and typographic details, so as to evoke the time period of the subject but also the modernity of the research endeavour. A major inspiration was the work of master book designer Jost Hochuli, and the project was partly a way to study his practice in comparison with otherschools of book design.</p>

Some letters are decorated by hand with details inspired by mid-century westernwear. All rules, typographical decorations, and type were letterpress-printed from the GSA Caseroom's wood type collection, or else gleaned from historical specimens or digitised wood typefaces and adapted for purpose; some were even hand-drawn for the occasion.

The torn ticket sets up the inciting event of the titular band's breakup, and on the back cover, fake newspaper clippings allude to the themes of fame, gossip and exposure in the book. The earthy orange colour, a 70’s staple, attracts the eye. Purposeful imperfections in the typesetting and period accurate fonts ensure an authentic, trade-printing feel.</p>
